gThumb is an image viewer and browser for the GNOME desktop.  It also
includes an importer tool for transferring photos from cameras.

gThumb supports printing multiple images on a single page using a printer
while many other image viewers don't support it.  Thus, it comes handy.

This is a GIT version >3.4 of gthumb that requires gtk+3!
See slack-required for the list of dependences, including 
clutter, libwebp, json-glib,  webkitgtk3, and gstreamer

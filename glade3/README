Here is revised Slack Build for the glade3 (Glade UI Designer version 3).
It is based on the official Slackware build files, but switches to GTK+3:

* bump the version number to 3.18.3 (that now includes 'libgladeui',
  which is requested by 'gtksourceview3')
* to ensure the proper library linking in "multilib" by pointing 
  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib${LIBDIRSUFFIX}" before ./configure
* Requesting doinst.sh to update icons and the desktop database

REQUIRED="atk cairo gdk-pixbuf2 glibc glib2 gtk+3 libxml2 pango"
OPTIONAL="devhelp pgobject3"

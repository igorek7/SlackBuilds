Here is revised Slack Build for the Glade based on the official Slackware
build files to:

* bump the version number to 3.18.3
* to ensure the proper library linking in "multilib" by pointing 
  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib${LIBDIRSUFFIX}" before ./configure
* Requesting doinst.sh to update icons and the desktop database

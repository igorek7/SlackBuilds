XSane is a GTK front end for SANE 

The built package will contain: the standalone 'xsane' program,
'xsane2tess' wraper script for for OCR with tesseract and xsane,
and the Gimp plugin, for both the gimp-2.8 and gimp-2.9 
(if 2.9 is installed).

WARNING: Plug-In "xsane"
(/opt/gimp-2.9/lib64/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/xsane)
calls deprecated procedure 'gimp-image-add-layer'.
It should call 'gimp-image-insert-layer' instead!

Don't forget to set your prefered OCR engine in XSane- Preferences -> OCR:
gocr -f UTF8
xsane2tess -l eng (tesseract --list-langs)
cuneiform -l eng

Enblend combines images that overlap into a single large image with no seams.
Enfuse combines images that overlap into a single image with good exposure
and good focus. Both programs assume that your images are already lined up.
To make panoramas with Enblend and/or Enfuse, use Hugin.

This SlackBuild is for the development Mercurial-version of enblend-enfuse.
SlackBuild has optional parameters set for parallelizing support of 
Enblend and Enfuse with: OpenMP --enable-openmp=yes,
OpenCL --enable-opencl=yes, or POSIX Threads (default).

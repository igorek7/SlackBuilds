libfpx (Kodak FlashPix) 

Kodak FlashPix (FPX) is a complex raster image file format intended for
use with photographic images. A FlashPix file contains either a single
image, or multiple representations of the same image at different
resolutions. The format is tile-oriented. A tile may use JPEG
compression, or be uncompressed. There is also a scheme to efficiently
encode tiles whose pixels are all the same color. 

The libfpx library is based on source code obtained from the Digital
Imaging Group Inc and the Eastman Kodak Company. is currently maintained
by the ImageMagick Studio LLC, http:://www.imagemagick.org/. It is
available from ftp://ftp.imagemagick.org/pub/ImageMagick/delegates/

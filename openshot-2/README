OpenShot 2 is a significant revision over its previous version 1.4.3,
now powered with its own new processing engine 'libopenshot'
instead of the MLT framework. The code has been switched from the GTK+ 
to Qt5 and Python3.

openshot2.SlackBuild would build the following required software: 
UnitTest++, OpenShot Audio Library (based on the JUICE project), 
OpenShot Video Library 'libopenshot' and OpenShot-2 'openshot-qt'. 
OpenShot-2 requires to run: qt5, python3, python3-PyQt5, ffmpeg | libav and
imagemagick, while to compile the package the C++ (gcc), Ruby, CMake, SWIG, 
Doxygen, and OpenMP are necessary.

Blender is an optional dependency (for animated titles): if you
use it, remember to set the full path for the blender executable
in the preferences.

The package name is going to be 'openshot2' to avoid conflicts  with the
possibly installed 1.4.3 version of OpenShot.  Use 'launch-openshot'
script  installed to /usr/bin to run OpenShot-2 from console, otherwise
look at 'Multimedia'->'Openshot 2.0' in in the desktop menu.

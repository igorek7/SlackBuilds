S2PLOT (3D plotting library)
is a an advanced three-dimensional plotting library 
with support for standard and enhanced display devices. 
The S2PLOT library was written in C and can be used with C, C++ and
FORTRAN programs. The S2PLOT architecture supports dynamic geometry 
and can be used to plot both static and time-evolving data sets. 
S2PLOT is based on the OpenGL graphics library. 

The generated plots can be saved in VRML format and embedded in PDF documents.

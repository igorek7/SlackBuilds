A few of my personal Linux Slackware Build scripts

A few of the Slackware Build scripts, to add extra software packages to my
Slackware-current(-ly it's 'pre-14.2') GNU Linux OS

Please, also note that many of my scripts are designed to install unstable
development versions of the software packages, and may require
corrections at any time when a source code is significantly modified
by its developers.
Prior to opt for my scripts, I would suggest to check: 
* the official Slackware packages http://www.slackware.com/changelog/
* SlackBuild.org http://slackbuilds.org 
* Eric Hameleers' (AlienBOB) http://www.slackware.com/~alien/slackbuilds/ , 
* PhantomX/slackbuilds http://phantomx.github.io/slackbuilds/
* Slackers/slackbuilds https://github.com/conraid/SlackBuilds

for the more stable and perhaps better tested versions.
My SlackBuild scripts are complementary to those.

All my scripts are tested to be working on my own Slackware 
configuration, based on: 
* the Slackware-current for the x86_64 architecture 
* Eric Hameleers' (AlienBOB) 'multilib'&'ktown_testing' (for the Frameworks 5)
* Ponce/SBo-git (current) https://github.com/Ponce/slackbuilds
* PhantomX/slackbuilds http://phantomx.github.io/slackbuilds/

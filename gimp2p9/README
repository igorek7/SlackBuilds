This SlackBuild script is to compile a development GIT version of the
gimp-2.9 together with the development GIT versions of the babl and gegl.
The built package will install the GIT version of the Gimp, babl and gegl
into a separate directory, /opt/gimp-2.9 allowing to run the gimp-2.9
independently from the installed stable version of the gimp-2.8, babl and
gegl provided with the Slackware.

The package name is going to be 'gimp2p9-...txz' to avoid conflicts 
with the Slackware 'gimp-2.8...txz' package.
The 'gimp-git' shell script installed to /usr/bin allows to run gimp-2.9
at /opt/gimp-2.9, otherwise look at 'Graphics'->'GIMP 2.9' in 
in the desktop menu.

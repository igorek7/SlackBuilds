The UFRaw (Unidentified Flying Raw) is a tool for reading and manipulating
raw images from digital cameras.  It supports most of the existing raw
formats (any format supported by DCRaw).  UFRaw can be used on its own or
as a Gimp plug-in.

UFRaw requires gtkimageview to include the image preview window. You can
build it without gtkimageview (run with GTK=no) but you'll only have
command line interface to UFRaw.

cfitsio (available in SBo) is an optional dependency to support FITS file
format.

The built package will contain the ufraw-gimp plugin for both, the gimp-2.8 
and gimp-2.9 (if 2.9 is installed).

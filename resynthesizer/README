Resynthesizer is a Gimp plug-in for texture synthesis. Given a sample
of a texture, it can create more of that texture. This has a surprising
number of uses:

    * Creating more of a texture
      (including creation of tileable textures)

    * Removing objects from images
      (great for touching up photos)

    * Creating themed images

This plug-in installs itself in the Filters/Map menu as "Resynthesize".
It generates a texture based on a sample image of the texture. The
result can be made to fit the boundary pixels of a region, or to have
a specified arrangement of features.

Also included in this package are some scripts that use Resynthesizer:

  Filters/Enhance/Smart enlarge 
  Filters/Enhance/Smart sharpen
  Filters/Enhance/Smart remove selection

Version 2.0 is a complete rewrite and is multithreaded.  Otherwise,
functionally the same except when compiled threaded it is
nondeterministic.

The build package will contain the plugin, both for the gimp-2.8 
and gimp-2.9 (if 2.9 is installed). 

Warning! Some of the resynthesizer utils, 'plugin-heal-transparency.py'
and 'plugin-heal-selection.py' call for the deprecated in gimp-2.9
procedures: 
* 'gimp-selection-layer-alpha' instead of 'gimp-image-select-item'
* 'gimp-selection-combine' instead of 'gimp-image-select-item'
* 'gimp-selection-load' instead of 'gimp-image-select-item' 
Nonetheless, despite of the warning messages, the procedures appear  to
be working in the current development version of gimp-2.9.  I'll try to
correct the python code for the gimp-2.9 in the future.

VIPS is a free image processing system. It includes a range of filters, 
arithmetic operations, colour processing, histograms, and geometric 
transforms. It supports ten pixel formats, from 8-bit unsigned int 
to 128-bit complex. As well as the usual JPEG, TIFF, PNG and WebP images,
it also supports scientific formats like FITS, OpenEXR, Matlab, Analyze, 
PFM, Radiance, OpenSlide and DICOM (via libMagick).

My SlackBuild script compiles the libvips library, that is required by the PhotoFlow image editor
